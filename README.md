### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It took me far too long to get an Visual Studio to run my simple program from a blank c++ file and not a console app.
But thanks to trial and error I managed it. WHOO!

Learnt Pyhton to the point of knowing the basics then decided to get into C++. A month later I am full immeresd in it and loving every minute of it. 

At the point where I need to take on a decent Project. Open source would be good. 

Future learning will be more python and then SQL.

Question: Why do all the Finance people use pyhton? 

Have a good one.

Fun Fact: I live in the darkest country in Europe.
