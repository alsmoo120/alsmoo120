### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It took me far too long to get Visual Studio to run my simple program from a blank c++ file

Learnt Pyhton to the point of knowing the basics then decided to get into C++. A month later I am full immeresd in it and loving every minute of it. 

 

Have a good one.

Fun Fact: I live in the darkest country in Europe.
